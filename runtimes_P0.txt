Run Times for P0
Author: Will Warren

Task 0: O(1) - These operations will take the same runtime no matter the size of inputs (m & n, texts and calls, respectively)

Task 1: O(m + n) - This runtime will grow linearly as m (texts) and n (calls) grow

Task 2: O(n) - This runtime will grow linearly as the n number of calls grows. The loop to find the max call time changes its run time in relation to n,
i.e. as the number of calls grows the number of entries in the collection of call times will grow.
    
Task 3: 
    Part A: O(N logN) - The sorted function has a runtime of O(N logN) and it is the dominant runtime.

    Part B: O(n) - Similar to Task 2, the size of the calls data set determines the runtime for this algorithm; the second loop through the (080) numbers
    will grow in relation to the calls data set.

Task 4: O(m +n) - This runtime will grow linearly as the size of m (texts) and n (calls) grows.
